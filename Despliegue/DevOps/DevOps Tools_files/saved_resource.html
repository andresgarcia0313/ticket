We\u2019ve broken the toolsets into what we see as the stages of the DevOps life cycle (adapted from \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\">the DevOps wikipedia page\u003c/a>). And while GitLab does not have most of the same functionality as TerraForm, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc, which are in the \u201cConfigure\u201d stage, it does have capabilities that we do classify as \u201cConfigure\u201d such as helping with Kubernetes configuration and secret configuration variable management. You can find more details on what capabilities GitLab has in each stage & category by \u003ca href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/configure\">clicking on the GitLab icon at the top of each stage\u003c/a>.\n\n\nSimilarly for Heroku and Snyk.\n\n\nI\u2019ve opened a GitLab Issue so we can \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/3691\">track making the intent of this page more clear\u003c/a>. \n\n\n\u003cb>Finally, RE: your \u003ca href=\"https://codefresh.io/continuous-integration/codefresh-versus-gitlabci/\">CodeFresh comparison\u003c/a>:\u003c/b>\n\n\nIt is a very nice piece of work with lot\u2019s of great data (I've linked it above so others can find it). Thank you for writing such a great piece. We have previously linked to it from \u003ca href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/codefresh/\">our CodeFresh tool page\u003c/a>, and identified where you are correct about what GitLab doesn\u2019t have yet, in addition to our Issues tracking each item. This is a great example of how us vendors can all keep pushing each other to become better for the industry and the community we are all a part of. \n\n\nThanks for helping to keep us honest, and we hope everyone will find value in this resource we are building (hopefully with your's and everyone\u2019s help).","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7086886933","forum":"gitlab","depth":1,"points":1,"moderationLabels":["links"],"isEdited":true,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2019-01-25T12:49:45","dislikes":1,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"\u003cblockquote>We are building out this page to be a resource (eventually) representing the whole DevOps toolchain landscape\u003c/blockquote>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>The title of the page \u003cb>\"GitLab compared to other DevOps tools\"\u003c/b> says otherwise.

You can either edit the page/info yourself and send us a merge request, open an issue and we’ll look into it, or email the necessary changes to devopstools@gitlab.com. (all this info is also listed at the bottom of each tool page).  Commenting on the page as you have is a good start too. I’ve opened this Issue to <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fgitlab-com%2Fmarketing%2Fproduct-marketing%2Fissues%2F214%3AMGooTNuq9xPwH-b0D37RMinBdE4&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/product-marketing/issues/214">track adding CodeFresh to the Package stage.</a></p><p>In short, thanks for letting us know when we missed the mark, and please help us get it right.</p><p><b>RE: GitLab in same column as TerraForm, Ansible, etc<br></b></p><p>Thank you, you’ve made us realize that the devops-tools page is not being clear on what it is presenting. We are building out this page to be a resource (eventually) representing the whole DevOps toolchain landscape. What is there is what we’ve been able to put in so far. We’ve broken the toolsets into what we see as the stages of the DevOps life cycle (adapted from <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDevOps%3AZdz-3FMhIP-ijGwe0t_61rxWrvE&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">the DevOps wikipedia page</a>). And while GitLab does not have most of the same functionality as TerraForm, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc, which are in the “Configure” stage, it does have capabilities that we do classify as “Configure” such as helping with Kubernetes configuration and secret configuration variable management. You can find more details on what capabilities GitLab has in each stage &amp; category by <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.gitlab.com%2Fstages-devops-lifecycle%2Fconfigure%3APKGAI1EMwAxyUETfsWrNCCzzXQk&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/configure">clicking on the GitLab icon at the top of each stage</a>.</p><p>Similarly for Heroku and Snyk.</p><p>I’ve opened a GitLab Issue so we can <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fgitlab-com%2Fwww-gitlab-com%2Fissues%2F3691%3A7iVNYTp1ZkMBPr2eEIrBeYhmlzo&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/3691">track making the intent of this page more clear</a>.</p><p><b>Finally, RE: your <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodefresh.io%2Fcontinuous-integration%2Fcodefresh-versus-gitlabci%2F%3ASh8l-NU2-ZwRjBqlDmQSwZW-x30&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://codefresh.io/continuous-integration/codefresh-versus-gitlabci/">CodeFresh comparison</a>:</b></p><p>It is a very nice piece of work with lot’s of great data (I've linked it above so others can find it). Thank you for writing such a great piece. We have previously linked to it from <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.gitlab.com%2Fdevops-tools%2Fcodefresh%2F%3Ag-eRlCFL8Hs_zlYUhZ8ShAMwd54&amp;cuid=2511589" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/codefresh/">our CodeFresh tool page</a>, and identified where you are correct about what GitLab doesn’t have yet, in addition to our Issues tracking each item. This is a great example of how us vendors can all keep pushing each other to become better for the industry and the community we are all a part of.</p><p>Thanks for helping to keep us honest, and we hope everyone will find value in this resource we are building (hopefully with your's and everyone’s help).</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul
